## Introduction

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text"><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This content was originally written in 2024 as a part of a proposal for the Starknet Documentation. Unfortunately, it wasnâ€™t published at the time, but I believe the information is still relevant and valuable for the community. Iâ€™ve decided to share it here, as it may provide useful insights or context to those interested in Starknet Improvement Proposals (SNIPs) and the ongoing development of the ecosystem.</div>
</div>

[Starknet Improvement Proposals (SNIPs)](https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs) are design documents that describe new features, improvements, and standards for the Starknet community. They include a detailed technical specification and rationale for the proposed changes and serve as the **source of truth** for the community.

## Importance of SNIPs

SNIPs are important for the development and improvement of the Starknet ecosystem. Here are some of the reasons:

* **Structured Development**: SNIPs provide a formal and organized process for proposing new features, improvements, and standards, ensuring thorough review and discussion before implementation.
    
* **Community Involvement**: They encourage active participation from the Starknet community by allowing anyone to propose and discuss changes, leading to more robust and well-rounded development.
    
* **Transparency**: The SNIP process promotes transparency in decision-making, with all the proposals and discussions publicly documented and accessible.
    
* **Quality Assurance**: The review process for SNIPs checks for technical soundness, feasibility, and alignment with Starknetâ€™s goals. This helps maintain the quality and reliability of new features and improvements.
    
* **Documentation and Standardization**: SNIPs are comprehensive documentation of all proposed and implemented changes, making integration easier for developers.
    
* **Future Planning**: SNIPs help shape the future of Starknet by providing a clear roadmap of proposed improvements and features, aligning and prioritizing development efforts with Starknetâ€™s vision.
    

To explore existing SNIPs, stay updated on ongoing proposals, and submit your own, visit the [Starknet SNIPs repository](https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs) and [Community Forum](https://community.starknet.io).

## Writing a SNIP

Writing a SNIP involves following the guidelines to ensure your proposal is well-structured, clear, and ready for community review. The SNIP process is based on the [Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) process](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1). Hereâ€™s how to get started:

1. Review and familiarize yourself with [SNIP-1](https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs/blob/main/SNIPS/snip-1.md)
    
2. Fork the [SNIPs repository](https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs)
    
3. Use the [SNIP template](https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs/blob/main/SNIPS/snip-template.md) to create your SNIP.
    
4. Submit a pull request (PR) to the [SNIPs repository](https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs) when your draft is complete.
    

Your first PR should be a draft of the final SNIP and must meet all formatting criteria, especially the correct metadata in the header. An editor reviews the PR, assigns it a number, and then merges it. Make sure you include a `discussions-to` header with the URL to a [forum](https://community.starknet.io/) or [GitHub issue](https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs/issues/new/choose) for community discussions.

## SNIP Life Cycle

To understand the stages your SNIP goes through from idea to finalization, check out the [SNIP Life Cycle](https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs?tab=readme-ov-file#snip-life-cycle). The life cycle includes stages such as Draft, Review, Last Call, and Final, as shown in the diagram below:

## SNIP Editors

SNIP editors are community members or StarkWare staff overseeing the administrative process of SNIPs. Their responsibilities include:

* Ensuring [correct formatting](https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs/blob/main/SNIPS/snip-1.md#snip-formats-and-templates) of submitted SNIPs
    
* Maintaining the [SNIPs repository](https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs)
    
* Reviewing SNIPs for technical soundness and feasibility
    
* Gathering opinions from StarkWare core teams for protocol changes
    

For more details, see the [SNIP Editor Responsibilities](https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs/blob/main/SNIPS/snip-1.md#snip-editor-responsibilities). The current SNIP editors (with their GitHub handles) are:

* Abdelhamid Bakhta ([@AbdelStark](https://github.com/AbdelStark))
    
* Ohad Barta ([@ob1337](https://github.com/ob1337))
